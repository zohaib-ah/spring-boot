# Spring Core Concepts




## Introduction to IoC Containers

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control flow of a program is inverted, i.e., the control is transferred from the application code to an external container. IoC containers are responsible for managing the lifecycle of application objects and injecting dependencies into the components.

### Key Concepts

1. **Dependency Injection (DI):** A technique where the dependencies of a class are injected from the outside rather than created within the class.

2. **Bean:** An object managed by the IoC container. In Spring, beans are the basic building blocks and are created, managed, and wired together by the container.

## Spring IoC Container

Spring Framework provides a robust IoC container that manages the components of a Spring-based application. The two main types of Spring IoC containers are:

1. **BeanFactory:** The simplest container that provides basic support for DI and lifecycle management. It is suitable for lightweight applications.

2. **ApplicationContext:** A more advanced container that builds on top of BeanFactory. It includes additional features like event propagation, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and more. ApplicationContext is widely used in Spring applications.

## Methods to Implement IoC in Java Spring Boot

### 1. XML Configuration

In the traditional approach, XML configuration files are used to define beans and their dependencies. Example configuration:

```xml
<!-- applicationContext.xml -->
<beans>
    <bean id="userService" class="com.example.UserService">
        <property name="userRepository" ref="userRepository"/>
    </bean>
    
    <bean id="userRepository" class="com.example.UserRepository"/>
</beans>
```

### 2. Annotation-based Configuration

With the advent of Spring annotations, you can use annotations like `@Component`(`@Controller`,`@Repository`, `@Service`), `@Autowired`, etc., to configure beans and dependencies.

```java
// UserService.java
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Java-based Configuration

Using Java-based configuration, you can define beans and their dependencies using Java code.

```java
// AppConfig.java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public UserService userService() {
        UserService userService = new UserService();
        userService.setUserRepository(userRepository());
        return userService;
    }

    @Bean
    public UserRepository userRepository() {
        return new UserRepository();
    }
}
```
